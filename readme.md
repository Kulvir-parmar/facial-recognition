# Facial Expression Recognition

### Introduction

This project is a facial expression recognition system based on deep learning. The system is able to recognize 7 basic facial expressions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral.

It is implemented in PyTorch using EfficientNet neural network architecture. The dataset used in this project is [this](https://github.com/parth1620/Facial-Expression-Dataset.git) from Github.
